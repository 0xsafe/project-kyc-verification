While we have utilized all available data to ensure transparent verification, it is important to note that you should not rely solely on the KYC document. We strongly recommend conducting independent KYC and public verifications of both the individual and the project. Please be aware that 0xsafe cannot guarantee the authenticity of the data provided in the KYC document, as the owner may have altered, modified, forged, or imitated it. Therefore, 0xsafe does not explicitly endorse the security of the KYC document.
